# cloud-security

In this next phase of my cloud security learning, I will be leveraging Whizlabs to complete more hands-on cloud security labs. Due to copyright restrictions, I wonâ€™t be able to share screenshots from these labs, but I will provide brief overviews and summaries of each lab experience to highlight key concepts, configurations, and security scenarios covered.
